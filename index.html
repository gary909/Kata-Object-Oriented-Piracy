        Task<br>
        <br>
        You have access to the ship "draft" and "crew". "Draft" is the total ship weight and "crew" <br>
        is the number of humans on the ship.<br>
        <br>
        Each crew member adds 1.5 units to the ship draft. If after removing the weight of the crew, <br>
        the draft is still more than 20, then the ship is worth looting. Any ship weighing that much <br>
        must have a lot of booty!<br>
        <br>
        Add the method<br>
        <br>
        isWorthIt<br>
        to decide if the ship is worthy to loot. For example:<br>
        <br>
        titanic.isWorthIt() // return false<br>
        This Kata teaches you the very basics of method creation.<br>
        <br>
        Good luck!<br>
